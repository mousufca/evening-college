                            <p>In 1966, St Aloysius College was given permission by Mysore University to start to an evening college for providing tuitions in the faculties of Arts and Commerce, at pre-university level.</p>
                        </div>
                        <div class="probootstrap-image probootstrap-animate" style="background:rgb(256,256,256);padding: 30px;box-shadow: 5px 5px 10px rgba(0,0,0,0.2)">
                            <p>For many who had to drop out from their regular education and take up jobs, the evening college allowed them to continue with their education and progress in their careers. For the 160 seats available in the first year, 200 applications came in.
                            </p>
                            <p>One year later, the B.Com. Degree course was introduced. This was also the year that the evening college was thrown open to women students. As it was difficult to run the B.A. and B. Com. classes simultaneously, it was a policy to admit students to the first year B.A and first year B. Com. classes in alternate years. This policy was done away with in 1971, largely due to the pressure of the students. Admissions to both the Arts and Commerce degree courses happened every year.</p>
                            <p>The college has had an impressive academic record. Though the percentage of results and the number of ranks a college secures are not the only criteria to judge the quality of education imparted, the results certainly reflect the efforts put by the students and the staff in a coordinated and systematic manner.</p>

                The Evening College is performing a very important service to the city of Mangalore and its neighbouring areas by becoming a haven to hundreds of men and women of this city and neighborhood, who would otherwise be denied the opportunity of collegiate education. The credit also goes to the students who after a grueling work day are enthusiastic and active participants in the rigorous class room instruction for nearly three more hours.
